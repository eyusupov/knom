# Engine
 - Negation
 - Add top-down inference when there is a question or a query.
 - Quoting? Is it log:ForallIn?
   ?head => { :steven :says ?head }
 - List length builtin
 - Recursive with guards? Allow fixpoint semantics for some stratas?

# Langserver integration
  - Since we have our own parser, we can do commands like rename variable that affect
     all inference graphs by using the AST, without renunning the inference. Basically per-character updates.
  - By keeping provenance of the inferred facts, we can delete rules and facts without restarting inference from scratch.
  - We can add rules and facts on the fly and rerun only affected parts based on the stratification algorithm
  - Real-time inference output
  - We can use reason ontology for all of this
